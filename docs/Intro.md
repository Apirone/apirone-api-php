# Intro

This library is a powerful API client written in PHP and is a complete wrapper for the [Apirone API](https://apirone.com/docs).

Apirone is a crypto payment processing provider, which allows users to manage a range of digital currencies, such as *Bitcoin*, *Litecoin*, *Bitcoin Cash*, *Dogecoin*, *Tron*, *Tether*, *USD Coin*.

We provide an API which enables developers to interact in a safe and secure, yet completely transparent way with the Apirone service. Using our API, clients can create and manage multi-currency accounts, generate invoices, view exchange rates, estimate the fees, and much more.
